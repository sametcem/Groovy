/*
It is possible to omit the type declaration of a field.
This is however considered a bad practice and in general it is a good idea to use strong typing for fields:


class BadPractice {
    private mapping //	the field mapping doesnâ€™t declare a type
}
class GoodPractice {
    private Map<String,String> mapping //the field mapping has a strong type
}
